            <p className={ this.props.className }>This is not an effective website or a web app for what it matters, so no
                terms of service are, were, or are going to be provided. Use this site as you please, having fun, or boring
                yourself to death. Really, we don't care. No effective service is provided by this site other than, you know,
                scoring a high grade for our exam.</p>
            <br />
            <p className={ this.props.className }>Please, be kind and respectful: be kind to the other users of this site, to
                the site itself, and to the developers. We put our sweat, tears, and a teeny-tiny drop of joy while creating
                this site. Also, be kind and respectful in general: be kind to other people, to your mom, to your grandpa, and
                to whoever you want. Being nice is not something that costs you money, you know.</p>
            <br />
            <p className={ this.props.className }>We do not tolerate or condone any type of verbal violence or harassment on
                this website; under any form or circumstance. Dude, we live in the future, where the Internet has taken over
                our lives; we literally killed God, and machines just think for us. And please, don't give us your stupid
                "free speech" speech: see if we care!</p>
            <br />
            <p className={ this.props.className }>Anyway, if you read until here, I have bad news for you: you're really nosy.
                So please refrain from further questions: this is not a press conference, just some random terms of service
                which no one will ever read.</p>
