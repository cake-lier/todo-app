                over-baked, the chocolate chips are in the right amount, no salt was added instead of sugar and all the like.
                Wait, weren't you talking about our freshly baked homemade cookies? Were you talking about our website
                cookies? Well, let me start again.</p>
            <br />
            <p className={ props.className }>You don't have to worry about our cookies, for real. Our cookies are only
                technical cookies, which are the best ones. They do not allow us to track you across other websites, do not
                allow profiling, do not allow ads selling you the same things you saw here.</p>
            <br />
            <p className={ props.className }>Those cookies only allow our app to work, plain and simple. For example, we
                need to keep you logged in between the website pages. Without a cookie, you couldn't do anything without
                logging in every time you click a link on our site. So please, accept our cookie policy: it is not something
                you'll regret later. It will only make your experience on our site as smooth as possible.</p>
